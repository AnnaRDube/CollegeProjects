These are some of my web development assignments. In the PHP project, I created a database to store questions used for a quiz. Then I created an application that allows users to take a quiz and check their answers. I also prototyped a redesign of a website for the Alabama Institute of Mindfulness using WordPress, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. This is the video that shows my prototype: http://mcs.athens.edu/~adube/communityPage.html
