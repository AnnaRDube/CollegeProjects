This is the project for Human-Computer Interaction. For this project, I designed and created a simple computer game. The computer game consisted of two games. The first was High Roll vs. Low Roll and the second was Sudoku. Before developing the game, I documented the human-computer interaction using the PACT framework, personas, and user scenarios, and I designed the game using interface sketches and HTA diagrams.
